# Movie Website Trailer

This project is part of the [UDACITY Full-Stack ND](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).  
The objective was to write a code with python, using classes and following the [Python PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

The code opens a website that shows a list of movies titles, their posters and trailers.  
I wrote the files media.py and entertainment_center.py, the file fresh_tomatoes was a base file to work with.

## Prerequisites

[Python](https://www.python.org/)

## How to use

Open entertainment\_center.py

## Code

*   fresh\_tomatoes.py contains the website code;
*   media.py contains the movie class;
*   entertainment\_center.py contains the instances and call the functions to the website.
